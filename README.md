My contributions to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly social data project that focuses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful and/or beautiful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}` and other tools that are part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
Feedback is very welcome via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lacapary).
